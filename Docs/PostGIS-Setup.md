The current setup is for [Fedora Linux 20](https://fedoraproject.org/), which is what I run most of the time. I do have a Windows laptop and will be porting this setup to it as part of the Hack Oregon project. I'm looking for a Mac user to port this to Macintosh laptops. If you use another Linux distro on your desktop, open an issue on Github and I'll do the port for you.

***Important note***: in PostgreSQL on Linux, there are two sets of users, Linux users and PostgreSQL database users. And PostgreSQL database users are called ***roles*** in PostgreSQL jargon. For most Linux desktop installations, things are easier if they are mapped one-to-one. That is, the PostgreSQL role 'znmeb' is the same person as the Linux user 'znmeb'.

When PostgreSQL is installed and configured, there will be a 'postgres' Linux user. And there will be a 'postgres' database role (user) inside the PostgreSQL database. The 'postgres' database role has 'superuser' powers - it can create other roles and in general mess with stuff inside PostgreSQL just like 'root' can on a Linux system. So for practical usage you'll ususally want to create a non-superuser role for day-to-day work.

## Install the Linux packages

```bash
./1yum-install-dependencies.bash
```

This will install 

* [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/),
* [pgAdmin](http://www.pgadmin.org/index.php),
* [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/),
* [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/),
* some [OpenStreetMap](www.openstreetmap.org/) tools, and
* any dependencies.

You only have to run this once. It won't hurt anything if you run it again.

## Configure PostgreSQL

```bash
./2configure-postgresql.bash
```

This script

* creates the PostgreSQL data area on the hard drive,
* enables the PostgreSQL server to start at boot time,
* starts the PostgreSQL server, and
* installs the 'adminpack' and 'plpgsql' extensions.

The script will ask you to create a password for the PostgreSQL 'superuser' role, named 'postgres'. You only have to run this script once, but it won't hurt anything if you run it again.

## Set up the PostGIS databases

```bash
./3set-up-postgis.bash
```

This will create a ***non-superuser*** PostgreSQL role with the same name as your Fedora Linux login. If the role exists already, it will be deleted and recreated. Then the script will create the following empty databases for that user:

* congress_districts: US Congressional districts for the whole USA
* state_legislature_upper_districts: Oregon State Senate districts
* state_legislature_lower_districts: Oregon State House districts
* unified_school_districts: Unified school districts for Oregon
* elementary_school_districts: Elementary school districts for Oregon
* secondary_school_districts: Secondary school districts for Oregon
* geocoder: A database for the TIGER geocoding / reverse geocoding package
* orestar: A database for the ORESTAR data
* voterreg: A database for the voter registration database

## Download the district shapefiles

```bash
./4download-tiger-districts.bash
```

This will download the shapefiles (except for the 'geocoder' data) required to populate the databases from the [US Census Bureau's TIGER/LineÂ® FTP site](http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html). The first time you run it, it will take longer because it's downloading, but subsequent runs will only download if the file has changed on the FTP site.

After the download, the script unpacks the ZIP archives and imports them into the databases. You can ignore the ERROR messages this script generates.

## Download the TIGER geocoder data.

This is a three-step process. For more details, see [_PostGIS in Action, Second Edition_](http://www.manning.com/obe2/).

### Create the download scripts.

```bash
./5make-geocoder-download-scripts.bash
```

This executes some code in the PostGIS package to create two scripts in `/gisdata`. One script, called 'state-county.bash', downloads nationwide state and county shapefiles. The second, called 'oregon.bash', downloads detailed shapefiles for Oregon.

### Edit the download scripts.

```bash
sudo su - postgres
cd /gisdata
```

This puts you into the PostgreSQL ***Linux*** maintenance account. The scripts require this 'superuser' privilege to run. Edit the two 'bash' scripts to set the ***PostgreSQL*** password for the 'postgres' role - you should have set this password in the 'Configure PostgreSQL' step. You'll see a line

```bash
export PGPASSWORD=yourpasswordhere
```

Change all instances of 'yourpasswordhere' to the PostgreSQL password for the 'postgres' role. Notes:
	
* There may be more than one instance; you need to change all of them.
* If your password contains special characters, you'll need to enclose it in single quotes. For example,

```
export PGPASSWORD='duck,duck:g00s3'
```

### Run the download scripts.

```bash
./state-county.bash
./oregon.bash
```

Like the previous download script, they will run longer the first time while downloading the raw data from the TIGER FTP site. Later ones will only download changed ZIP archives.

## Loading the ORESTAR database

This step is optional - so far we don't have any spatial use cases for this database. But if you want to explore it, here's how:

1. Get a copy of the file 'hackoregon.sql.bz2'.
1. In a terminal, type

```bash
sudo su - postgres
bzip2 -dc /path/to/hackoregon.sql.bz2 | psql -d orestar
```

The contents of the database dump file will be restored to the 'orestar' database.

## Loading the district precinct detail database

This step is optional. I think this will be useful for the project, especially Ballot Path, but we need some documentation on what the data means.

1. Get a copy of the directory 'voter_reg'.
1. In a terminal, type

```bash
./create-district-precinct-detail.bash /path/to/voter_reg
```

The script will unzip the input file, clean it up, create the 'district_precinct_detail' table in the 'voterreg' database and copy the data into the table.
