The current setup is for [Fedora Linux 20](https://fedoraproject.org/),
which is what I run most of the time. I do have a Windows laptop and
will be porting this setup to it as part of the Hack Oregon project. I'm
looking for a Mac user to port this to Macintosh laptops. If you use
another Linux distro on your desktop, open an issue on Github and I'll
do the port for you.

***Important note***: in PostgreSQL on Linux, there are two sets of
users, Linux users and PostgreSQL database users. And PostgreSQL
database users are called ***roles*** in PostgreSQL jargon. For most
Linux desktop installations, things are easier if they are mapped
one-to-one. That is, the PostgreSQL role 'znmeb' is the same person as
the Linux user 'znmeb'.

When PostgreSQL is installed and configured, there will be a 'postgres'
Linux user. And there will be a 'postgres' database role (user) inside
the PostgreSQL database. The 'postgres' database role has 'superuser'
powers - it can create other roles and in general mess with stuff inside
PostgreSQL just like 'root' can on a Linux system. So for practical
usage you'll ususally want to create a non-superuser role for day-to-day
work.

Install the Linux packages
--------------------------

    ./1yum-install-dependencies.bash

This will install

-   [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/),
-   [pgAdmin](http://www.pgadmin.org/index.php),
-   [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/),
-   [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/),
-   some [OpenStreetMap](www.openstreetmap.org/) tools, and
-   any dependencies.

You only have to run this once. It won't hurt anything if you run it
again.

Configure PostgreSQL
--------------------

    ./2configure-postgresql.bash

This script

-   creates the PostgreSQL data area on the hard drive,
-   enables the PostgreSQL server to start at boot time,
-   starts the PostgreSQL server, and
-   installs the 'adminpack' and 'plpgsql' extensions.

The script will ask you to create a password for the PostgreSQL
'superuser' role, named 'postgres'. You only have to run this script
once, but it won't hurt anything if you run it again.

Set up the PostGIS databases
----------------------------

    ./3set-up-postgis.bash

This will create a ***non-superuser*** PostgreSQL role with the same
name as your Fedora Linux login. If the role exists already, it will be
deleted and recreated. Then the script will create the following empty
databases for that user:

-   congress\_districts: US Congressional districts for the whole USA
-   state\_legislature\_upper\_districts: Oregon State Senate districts
-   state\_legislature\_lower\_districts: Oregon State House districts
-   unified\_school\_districts: Unified school districts for Oregon
-   elementary\_school\_districts: Elementary school districts for
    Oregon
-   secondary\_school\_districts: Secondary school districts for Oregon
-   geocoder: A database for the TIGER/Line速 geocoding / reverse
    geocoding package
-   orestar: A database for the ORESTAR data
-   voterreg: A database for the voter registration database

Download the district shapefiles
--------------------------------

    ./4download-tiger-districts.bash

This will download the shapefiles (except for the 'geocoder' data)
required to populate the databases from the [US Census Bureau's
TIGER/Line速 FTP
site](http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-line.html). The
first time you run it, it will take longer because it's downloading, but
subsequent runs will only download if the file has changed on the FTP
site.

After the download, the script unpacks the ZIP archives and imports them
into the databases. You can ignore the ERROR messages this script
generates.

Download the TIGER/Line速 geocoder data.
---------------------------------------

This is a three-step process. For more details, see [*PostGIS in Action,
Second Edition*](http://www.manning.com/obe2/).

### Create the download scripts.

    ./5make-geocoder-download-scripts.bash

This executes some code in the PostGIS package to create two scripts in
`/gisdata`. One script, called 'state-county.bash', downloads nationwide
state and county shapefiles. The second, called 'oregon.bash', downloads
detailed shapefiles for Oregon.

### Edit the download scripts.

    sudo su - postgres
    cd /gisdata

This puts you into the PostgreSQL ***Linux*** maintenance account. The
scripts require this 'superuser' privilege to run. Edit the two 'bash'
scripts to set the ***PostgreSQL*** password for the 'postgres' role -
you should have set this password in the 'Configure PostgreSQL' step.
You'll see a line

    export PGPASSWORD=yourpasswordhere

Change all instances of 'yourpasswordhere' to the PostgreSQL password
for the 'postgres' role. Notes:

-   There may be more than one instance; you need to change all of them.
-   If your password contains special characters, you'll need to enclose
    it in single quotes. For example,

<!-- -->

    export PGPASSWORD='duck,duck:g00s3'

### Run the download scripts.

    ./state-county.bash
    ./oregon.bash

Like the previous download script, they will run longer the first time
while downloading the raw data from the TIGER/Line速 FTP site. Later ones
will only download changed ZIP archives.

Loading the ORESTAR database (optional)
---------------------------------------

This step is optional - so far we don't have any spatial use cases for
this database. But if you want to explore it, here's how:

1.  Get a copy of the file 'hackoregon.sql.bz2'.
2.  In a terminal, type

<!-- -->

    sudo su - postgres
    bzip2 -dc /path/to/hackoregon.sql.bz2 | psql -d orestar

The contents of the database dump file will be restored to the 'orestar'
database.

Loading the district precinct detail database (optional)
--------------------------------------------------------

This step is optional. I think this will be useful for the project,
especially Ballot Path, but we need some documentation on what the data
means.

1.  Get a copy of the directory 'voter\_reg'.
2.  In a terminal, type

<!-- -->

    ./create-district-precinct-detail.bash /path/to/voter_reg

The script will unzip the input file, clean it up, create the
'district\_precinct\_detail' table in the 'voterreg' database and copy
the data into the table.
